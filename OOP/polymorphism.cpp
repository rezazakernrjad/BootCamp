/*
The word polymorphism means having many forms. 
Typically, polymorphism occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes 
and they are related by inheritance.

C++ polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function 
to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function.

Consider the following example where a base class has been derived by other two classes âˆ’
